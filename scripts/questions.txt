How much of this will the students implement? the entirety of localize plus movement decisions? More or less than that?
    maybe makes the most sense to implement the map and sensor nodes, and have the students implement the robot node from scratch
does the localize function need to change
how easy is it going to be to install things (via apt-get, pip, etc) on the virtualbox? i.e. can I use yaml, json, etc
